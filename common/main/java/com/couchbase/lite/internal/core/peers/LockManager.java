/**
 * This is the new locking strategy.  It originated with Jim Borden and is a huge improvement
 * for maintainability.
 *
 * The old strategy acquired the db lock *first* in any method that might call into a LiteCore
 * method that was not thread safe.  The Replicator lock was second and other locks were acquired
 * haphazardly.
 *
 * The LiteCore documentation now annotates every API method with the locks that must be held
 * when the method is called.  By propagating those annotations up through the Java code
 * we can now ensure that the correct locks are held when calling into LiteCore methods.
 * The LiteCore locks are now the *last* lock acquired, still Database first, then Replicator
 * then others.
 *
 * Note that the new and old locking strategies are compatible.  As long as locks are acquired
 * in order there should be no risk of deadlock.
 *
 * After using this a bit, I believe that the best practice is for the lock-protected instance to
 * retrieve its lock and then to pass it to any dependent objects that need it.  THat guarantees
 * that the dependents are using the correct lock and that the lock is not released until
 * the last dependent is done with it.
 *
 * The following classes have been converted to use this new locking strategy:
 * C4BlobReadStream.java
 * C4BlobStore.java
 * C4BlobWriteStream.java
 * C4Collection.java
 * C4Database.java
 * C4Replicator.java
 * C4TestUtils.java
