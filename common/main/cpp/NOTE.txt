If you add a new file, here, be sure to add it to the add_library instruction
in ../../CMakeLists.txt

If you add or remove a method from any of these files, you must edit the related
loader config files.  There are seven of them:
-  <root>/ee/java/etc/ld/jni_osx.ld, <root>/ce/java/etc/ld/jni_osx.ld: Java on OSX, uses wildcards; probably don't need modification
-  <root>/ee/java/etc/ld/jni_win.ld, <root>/ce/java/etc/ld/jni_win.ld: Java on Windows
-  <root>/ee/java/etc/ld/jni_gnu.ld, <root>/ce/java/etc/ld/jni_gnu.ld: Java on Linux
-  <root>/common/common/jni_android.ld: Android, but CE and EE
