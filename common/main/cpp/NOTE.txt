If you add a new file, here, be sure to add it to the add_library instruction
in ../../CMakeLists.txt

If you add or remove a method from any of these files, you must edit the related
loader config files.  There are eight of them:
-  <root>/[ce]e/java/etc/ld/jni_osx.ld: Java CE and EE on OSX.  Uses wildcards; probably don't need modification
-  <root>/[ce]e/java/etc/ld/jni_win.ld: Java CE and EE on Windows
-  <root>/[ce]e/java/etc/ld/jni_gnu.ld: Java on Linux
-  <root>/[ce]e/android/etc/ld/jni_android.ld: Java on Android
